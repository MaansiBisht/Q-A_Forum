# Q-A Forum

Nowadays, everyone is so busy and occupied that they want ease of work. With limited time, there is a need for these types of applications that provide all the facilities to the client (user), as well as the manager or administrator. The admin can now handle all of its questions and answers added to the forum. Additionally, the user can receive answers from different users from the comfort of his own home. The user can also see answers posted by himself or others. All the answers posted by users are monitored by the manager. Admins are entitled to cancel or edit answers before posting them.

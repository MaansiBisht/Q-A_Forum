Q-A Forum

Nowadays when everyone is so busy and occupied, we all want ease of work. And with the lack of time arises the need for these kinds of applications that would provide all the facilities to the customer (user), and the manager/admin at one place. Now, theadmin can handle all its questions  and answers added to the forum.
And on the other hand, the user can answer his question  from different users sitting at his home. He also sees the answers posted by him or others.
The manager supervises all the answers posted which are being made by the user. The admin has the right to cancel or finalize any  answer before posting.
